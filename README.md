Greetings, before starting the lessons, I would like to give you some information about the web.But before that, there are a few things I want to tell you.
You cannot learn software by just reading and watching, this is true for all programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand many other things. You must put into practice what you have learned, and understand what is useful for what purpose. If you really want to learn, follow me on this journey and do the necessary things.Have fun everyone hereüòÅ
# Web Software
Web software is software used to add features to the HTML markup language that forms the basis of websites. Thanks to this software, websites can update themselves automatically without the need for a person to edit them.

There are no restrictions in web software; you can make any project you have in mind concrete by making the necessary preparations. The main factor here is that web software is not created in a single language. Web software is developed using many languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Python**, **PHP**. The important thing here is which language will best meet your needs. This selection is made by professionals and they do the planning and coding.

# Key Components of Web Content
-  **Frontend**
  
Frontend is the surface layer of the web application that users directly interact with and can see visually. Technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used in the frontend development process.
-  **Backend**
  
The backend is managed throughout the web server and is the part that users cannot see. The backend contains transfers such as database data and server-side programming. Technologies used in the backend development process include languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as PHP, Python, Ruby and Java.
-  **Database**
  
The he database allows storing and managing data used in web applications. There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. These types include popular database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Couchbase.
# Web
Web software offers significant value to businesses and users today. Developing web applications can be accomplished successfully by understanding the basic components and development processes and choosing the right approaches. Developers' and project managers' planning and implementation of web software projects by taking these processes and approaches into consideration will help improve the quality, performance and user satisfaction of the application.
